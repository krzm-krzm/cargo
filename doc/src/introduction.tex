\section{Introduction}

This document provides reference for the \code{libcargo} C++11 software
library.  The library is designed to facilitate implementing and evaluating
ridesharing algorithms.  Many features (like error handling) are missing,
however the current state is usable, and several examples are included in the
release package.  If you would like to contribute to its development, please
submit a pull request to the github
repository\footnote{https://github.com/jamjpan/Cargo}.
